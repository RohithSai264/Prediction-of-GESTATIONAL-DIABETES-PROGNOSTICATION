# Prediction-of-GESTATIONAL-DIABETES-PROGNOSTICATION
 The Data Analysis (DA) is conducted to understand the various data sources and collected the

contextualized Pima Indians Diabetes dataset from the UCI repository.

The collected dataset is cleaned ,that is the removal of the duplicate and missing values as a step of data

pre-processing.

 The dataset which is cleaned is divided into training dataset and testing dataset.
The training dataset is used for building the model and testing dataset is used for testing the model’s

performance.

Feature Scaling is done to standardize the independent features present in the data in a fixed range. It is

performed to handle highly varying magnitudes or values or units.

 Grid-search is used to find the optimal hyper parameters of a model which results in the most ‘accurate’

predictions.

 A set of candidate classification models are identified for the experiment on the training dataset to fit a

model.

 The candidate classification models used here are Naive Baye’s classifier, Support Vector Machine,

Decision Tree and Random Forest.

 Then the models are assessed based on various performance metrics such as Accuracy , Recall, f1-Score,

Precision.

Thus , comparing the models based on the various performance metrics to analyze the accuracy of a

model for the dataset.
